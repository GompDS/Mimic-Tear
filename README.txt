This is a tool for Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro which automates the process of creating a subspecies of an enemy.

--| How to use

Enter the required information into config.ini, select game, select conversion settings and finally run MimicTear.exe.

This has only been tested on Windows, so it probably won't work only other systems.

The path to this folder cannot contain any spaces or else MimicTear.exe will not function correctly.
